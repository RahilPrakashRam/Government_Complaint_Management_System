**Background:**
In the wake of advancing technology and the growing expectations of citizens, our government is committed to enhancing public services and addressing citizens' concerns effectively. One crucial aspect of this commitment is the establishment of a comprehensive Complaint Management System (CMS) that allows citizens to submit their grievances, feedback, and complaints seamlessly.

2. **Efficiency:** Improve the efficiency of the complaint resolution process by automating workflows and ensuring timely responses.
3. **Accountability:** Establish accountability by assigning and tracking complaints to the respective government departments and officials responsible for resolution.
4. **Data-Driven Decision-Making:** Utilize data generated by the CMS to identify recurring issues, assess the performance of government departments, and make informed policy decisions.
